## Intro

A big part of what we do at [JustGiving](http://www.justgiving.com) is reclaim the [Gift Aid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_Aid) on donations made to charities. This saves them a lot of time and processing overheads.

This assignment is a very small task to create a Gift Aid calculator.

For reference, Gift Aid is calculated as follows:

`[Donation Amount] * ( [TaxRate] / (100 - [TaxRate]) )`

- This assignment takes an average of about 30 minutes.
- We use [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org) and [Moq](http://code.google.com/p/moq) at JustGiving, references have been added using [NuGet](http://nuget.codeplex.com/) Packages. Everything is in place for you to just write the code (no "File > New Project" required).

## Task requirements

- All stories to be completed with an appropriate level of testing.
- No actual database implementation is required, feel free to stub it out.
- Your code should trend towards being SOLID.
- Please [download](https://github.com/JustGiving/Recruitment-Test/archives/master) the [Recruitment-Test repository](https://github.com/JustGiving/Recruitment-Test), complete the tasks as you see fit.
- Send us a Dropbox/Skydrive/whatever link to your zipped code to james.adams@justgiving.com but please do not send attached zip files via email!
